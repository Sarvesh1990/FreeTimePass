/*
Mother vertex is vertex from which we can reach to all other vertex in graph.
Mother vertex is last visited vertex in graph dfs.
Do DFS. Put vertex in stack. Do DFS for all the nodes which are not visited. Top vertex in the stack can be the mother vertex.
Do one more DFS from top vertex to confirm.
